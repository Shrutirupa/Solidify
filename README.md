# Solidify
My tool will create smart contracts and also perform security checks

This is a simple python program to write a code in Solidity for Ethereum Based Smart Contracts. Once completely done with the first step, the code is supposed to be compiling the contract code and perform security checks as well.

It can also just perform security checks for an already written Solidity Based Smart Contract.

PS: Development is still in progress
Improvisation will be done in the later stage.
